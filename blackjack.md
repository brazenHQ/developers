# Rules to Blackjack

## Deck
Blackjack is played with a standard deck of 52 playing cards.
* The deck is divided into the following 4 suits: ♣ (clubs), ♦ (diamonds), ♥ (hearts), ♠ (spades)
* Each suit has 13 cards with the following face values: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, J (Jack), Q (Queen), K (King), A (Ace)
  
## Players
Players consist of the dealer and one or more non-dealer players.

## Scoring
The goal of the game is to be player whose hand is the closest to 21 points, without going over.
* Faces 2 through 10 are worth their face value.
* J, Q, and K are worth 10.
* Ace can be valued at either 1 or 11, depending on which is better for the player’s hand.
* A player with more than 21 points “goes bust” and is out of the round.

## Play
* The dealer starts the game by shuffling the full deck and placing it face-down.
* The dealer starts a round by dealing one face-down card to each player, including themself, and then dealing one face-up card to each player.
  * The player's face-down card is known only to them; their face-up card is known to all players.
* Starting to the left of the dealer, each player will declare that they want to “stay” (receive no additional cards) or “hit” (receive one additional card).
  * Once a player stays, they cannot take any further actions in the round.
  * A player can hit as many times as they like, until they decide to stay or they go bust.
* Once all players have stayed or gone bust, the player with the hand closest to 21, without going bust, wins.
* Cards are returned to the dealer and a new round can begin.
* Previously dealt cards are not reused until the deck is empty, at which point they are reshuffled and become the draw pile.

## Advanced Rules
Advanced rules include betting on hands, standardized hit/stay actions for the dealer, multiple decks, “natural”/”blackjack” hands, “splitting” your hand, and “doubling down” on your bet. Feel free to research these rules and include them if you desire. This exercise is more about modeling than creating the most complete Blackjack game.
